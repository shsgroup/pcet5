\chapter{Introduction}
PCET is a package designed to calculate the free energy surfaces
and nonadiabatic rates of proton-coupled electron transfer reactions in
polar medium \cite{pcet-jcp1,pcet-jacs,pcet-jcp2,pcet-jpc}. The original
version 2.1 combines all the original codes developed for specific model
systems and written separately by different authors. The original
main frame (A. Soudackov) included a simple ellipsoidal electrostatic
model for solvation calculations and a four-state EVB model with
standard MM parameterization for calculation of gas-phase potential.
Later this code was modified (H. Decornez) to include the Voth-Schmitt
EVB potential for water clusters. Another modification (I. Rostov)
concerned the inclusion of Frequency Resolved Cavity Model (FRCM) for
advanced solvation calculations. The combined interface to all the
original codes was written by A. Soudackov and constitutes the package
PCET 2.1. The latest version (3.0, A. SOudackov and E. Hatcher) includes
also the additional LEPS based two-dimensional gas-phase potential,
developed for enzyme applications, and effects of gating coordinate
(PT donor-acceptor distance).

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Quantization algorithm}
The one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equations for the proton

Fourier Grid Hamiltonian representation \cite{Webb-DFGH}

\subsection{Limitations}

There are two main limitations in the current version of PCET
program:
\begin{itemize}
\item the four-state MS-EVB model is implemented. It means that
      maximum two coupled charge transfer processes can be
      described. Accordingly, maximum four different charge
      distributions in the reacting system can be defined.
\item only one quantum particle moving in one dimension
      and one gating coordinate (proton donor-acceptor distance)
      can be taken into account explicitly.
\end{itemize}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Programming Language}
All the routines in the current version of PCET are written
mostly in FORTRAN-77. Memory allocation is done using
FORTRAN-90 rules and syntaxis. FORTRAN-90 features
used in FRCM related routines were removed to maintain
the overall consistence.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Target Computers}
Currently, PCET 3.0 can be compiled for the following platforms:
\begin{itemize}
\item SGI under IRIX 6.4/6.5 (SGI f90 compiler)
\item LINUX 2.2.14 (Portland Group compiler pgf90)
\end{itemize}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Required External Libraries}
No libraries required.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Arithmetic Precision}
All real variables and parameters are specified as real*8 (64-bit).

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Units}
The program uses kcal/mol for energy and Angstr\"oms for length.
All the charges and masses are in atomic units.

\chapter{Theoretical Background}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Four-state Continuum Model for PCET reactions}

The electronic Hamiltonian of the PCET system (solute with
the surrounding continuum medium) is represented in the basis
of the following four valence bond (VB) states:

\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{lllcrlcrlcl}
(1a)&&\mbox{D$_{{\mathrm e}}$}^\ominus&-&^\oplus\mbox{D$_{{\mathrm p}}$}&\mbox{H}&\cdots
&\cdots&\mbox{A$_{{\mathrm p}}$}^\ominus&-&\mbox{A$_{{\mathrm e}}$} \\
(1b)&&\mbox{D$_{{\mathrm e}}$}^\ominus&-&\mbox{D$_{{\mathrm p}}$}&\cdots
&\cdots&\mbox{H}&\mbox{A$_{{\mathrm p}}$}
&-&\mbox{A$_{{\mathrm e}}$} \\
(2a)&&\mbox{D$_{{\mathrm e}}$}&-&^\oplus\mbox{D$_{{\mathrm p}}$}&\mbox{H}
&\cdots&\cdots&\mbox{A$_{{\mathrm p}}$}^\ominus&-&\mbox{A$_{{\mathrm e}}$}^\ominus \\
(2b)&&\mbox{D$_{{\mathrm e}}$}&-&\mbox{D$_{{\mathrm p}}$}&\cdots&\cdots&
\mbox{H}&\mbox{A$_{{\mathrm p}}$}&-&\mbox{A$_{{\mathrm e}}$}^\ominus.
\end{array}
\label{eq.definepcetvb}
\end{equation}
%
Here the symbols D$_{\mathrm e}$ and A$_{\mathrm e}$ represent
a general electron donor and acceptor,
D$_{\mathrm p}$ and A$_{\mathrm p}$ represent
a general proton donor and acceptor, and H represents the transferring
proton. The VB states are labeled as follows:
$a$ denotes that the proton is bonded to its donor while
$b$ denotes that the proton is
bonded to its acceptor, and
1 denotes that the electron is localized on its donor while
2 denotes that the electron is localized on its acceptor.
Thus, $a$ and $b$ indicate the proton transfer (PT) state, and
1 and 2 indicate the electron transfer (ET) state.

The electrostatic interaction of the solute with the continuum
solvent is described in terms of the two scalar solvent variables
$z_p$ and $z_e$ corresponding to the PT and ET processes,
respectively:
\begin{eqnarray}
z_p &=& \int d{\bf r}\,\,[\rho_{1b}({\bf r})-\rho_{1a}({\bf r})]
\phi_{\mathrm{in}}({\bf r}) \nonumber \\
z_e &=& \int d{\bf r}\,\,[\rho_{2a}({\bf r})-\rho_{1a}({\bf r})]
\phi_{\mathrm{in}}({\bf r}),
\end{eqnarray}
where $\rho_{ii}({\bf r})$ is the total charge density
of VB state $i$ and $\phi_{\mathrm{in}}({\bf r})$ is the inertial
polarization field of the solvent.

The electronic Hamiltonian matrix representing the free energy
of the PCET system as a function of two solute nuclear coordinates
(including the coordinate $r_p$ of the quantum particle and the gating
coordinate $R$ defined as the proton donor-acceptor distance) and
two solvent variables $z_p$ and $z_e$ has a form:
\begin{equation}
{\bf H}(r_p,R,z_p,z_e) = {\cal{S}}(r_p,R,z_p,z_e){\bf I}+ {\bf H}_o(r_p,R)
+
\left(
\begin{array}{cccc}
0&0&0&0 \\
0&z_p&0&0 \\
0&0&z_e&0 \\
0&0&0&z_p+z_e 
\end{array}
\right).
\label{eq.PCETham}
\end{equation}
The transformed self-energy ${\cal{S}}(r_p,R,z_p,z_e)$ of the solvent
inertial polarization field is expressed as
%
\begin{equation}
{\cal{S}}(r_p,R,z_p,z_e)=\frac{1}{2} \sum_{i,j=1b,2a}\bigg\{
\left[ y_{i}'+t_{1a,i}'(r_p,R)\right] \left[
{\bf t}_t'(r_p,R)^{-1}\right]_{i,j}\left[ y_{j}'+t_{1a,j}'(r_p,R)\right]
\bigg\} -\frac{1}{2} t'_{1a,1a}(r_p,R),
\end{equation}
%
where the summation runs over valence bond states $1b$ and $2a$,
the truncated reorganization energy matrix ${\bf t}_t'$ has
dimensions $2\times 2$ corresponding to these two states,
and $(z_p,z_e)\equiv (y_{1b}',y_{2a}')$. The inertial
reorganization energy matrix elements $t_{ij}'$ can
be expressed as
%
\begin{equation}
t_{ij}'=-\int d{\bf r}\,\, \nu_{jj}({\bf r})
[\hat{K}(\epsilon_o)-\hat{K}(\epsilon_\infty)]\nu_{ii}({\bf r}),
\end{equation}
%
where $\hat{K}(\epsilon)$ is the dielectric Green function
for the medium with dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and
%
\begin{eqnarray}
\nu_{1a,1a}({\bf r})&=&\rho_{1a,1a}({\bf r}) \nonumber \\
\nu_{ii}({\bf r})&=&\rho_{ii}({\bf r})-\rho_{1a,1a}({\bf r})\,\,\,\,\,
(i=1b,2a,2b).
\end{eqnarray}
%
Finally, ${\bf H}_o(r_p,R)$ is the gas phase electronic Hamiltonian
matrix.

The free energy surfaces of the system in space of the solute nuclear
coordinates and two solvent coordinates are obtained by the
diagonalization of the matrix (\ref{eq.PCETham}).

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Mixed Electronic/Vibrational Free Energy Surfaces}
To take into account the quantum nature of the transferring proton
(or other light particle) with the coordinate $r_p$ one needs to
solve the Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
H^{\rm total}({\bf r}^{(e)},r_p,R,z_p,z_e) \Phi_n({\bf r}^{(e)},r_p;R,z_p,z_e)=
E_n(R,z_p,z_e) \Phi_n({\bf r}^{(e)},r_p;R,z_p,z_e)
\label{eq:el-vib}
\end{equation}
Here $H^{\rm total}$ is the total Hamiltonian for fixed solvent and gating
coordinates $(R,z_p,z_e)$ and can be expressed as
%
\begin{equation}
H'({\bf r}^{(e)},r_p,R,z_p,z_e)
= -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_p}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r_p^2} +
{\bf H}({\bf r}^{(e)},r_p,R,z_p,z_e)
\label{eq.hprime}
\end{equation}
where the first term is the kinetic energy of the transferring
proton and the second term is the electronic
Hamiltonian defined in Eq.~\ref{eq.PCETham}. The quantities
$E_n(R,z_p,z_e)$ represent the free energies of the mixed
{\em electronic/vibrational} (vibronic) states
$\Phi_n({\bf r}^{(e)},r_p;R,z_p,z_e)$.

In the case of the quantization along the gating coordinate...

\subsection{Methods of Solution of Eq.(\ref{eq:el-vib})}

In the program PCET, three different methods of solution
of the equation (\ref{eq:el-vib}) are implemented. In
all these methods the total Hamiltonian is represented
in the basis of the products of electronic and vibrational
wavefunctions.

\subsubsection{Method 1: based on diabatic electronic states}
In this approach the mixed electronic/proton
vibrational adiabatic states are expanded in a basis of
products of diabatic electronic states and corresponding
adiabatic proton vibrational states. The approach consists
of three steps.

The first step is to
calculate the energies of the electronic diabatic states for fixed
solvent coordinates $(z_p,z_e)$ 
for all points $r_p$ along a one-dimensional grid
between the proton donor and acceptor.  The energy of the diabatic
electronic state $i$ is 
%
\begin{equation}
E_i^{\mathrm{(dia)}}(r_p,z_p,z_e)=H_{ii}(r_p,z_p,z_e)
\end{equation}
\par
The second step is to calculate the proton vibrational
adiabatic states $\phi_\mu^{(i)}(r_p;z_p,z_e)$ for
fixed solvent coordinates for each diabatic electronic state $i$
by numerically solving the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation
%
\begin{equation}
\left( -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_p}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r_p^2}
+E_i^{\mathrm{(dia)}}\right)
\phi_\mu^{(i)}(r_p;z_p,z_e)=\epsilon_\mu^{(i)}(z_p,z_e)
\phi_\mu^{(i)}(r_p;z_p,z_e).
\end{equation}
%
This equation is solved
by expanding the proton vibrational states 
on a grid along the axis between the
proton donor and acceptor and implementing standard discrete
Fourier grid techniques.
\par
The third step in this approach is to calculate the 
numerically exact mixed electronic/proton
vibrational adiabatic states by expanding them in terms of
basis states each comprised of a product of an electronic diabatic state $i$
and a proton vibrational adiabatic state $\phi_\mu^{(i)}$.
The mixed electronic/vibrational states are calculated by
solving the matrix equation
%
\begin{equation}
{\bf H}^{\rm total} {\bf D}={\bf D}{\bf E},
\end{equation}
%
where ${\bf D}$ has elements $D_{i\mu,n}$, ${\bf E}$ is diagonal with
elements $E_{n}$, and
the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian ${\bf H}^{\rm total}$ are
%
\begin{equation}
H_{i\mu,j\nu}^{\rm total} =
\delta_{ij}\delta_{\mu\nu}\epsilon_\mu^{(i)}(z_p,z_e)+
(1-\delta_{ij})\left\langle \phi_\mu^{(i)}\left|
{H}_{ij}\right|\phi_\nu^{(j)}\right\rangle_p .
\label{eq.hinjmd}
\end{equation}
%
(Here $\langle \ldots \rangle_p$ indicates integration over $r_p$.)
The energies of the mixed electronic/proton vibrational
adiabatic states can be calculated
as functions of the two solvent scalar variables $z_p$ and $z_e$
by following these three steps for solvent coordinates $(z_p,z_e)$
on a two-dimensional grid.

\subsubsection{Method 2: based on adiabatic electronic states}
In this approach the mixed electronic/proton
vibrational adiabatic states are expanded in a basis of
double adiabatic states. The approach consists of three steps.
The first step is to calculate the electronic
adiabatic states $\Psi_k({\bf r}^{(e)};r_p,z_p,z_e)$ 
for fixed solvent
coordinates $(z_p,z_e)$ for all points $r_p$ along a one-dimensional grid
between the proton donor and acceptor.
The electronic wavefunction
$\Psi_k$ is a linear combination of
the four valence bond states (1a, 1b, 2a, 2b).
The energy of electronic state $k$ is
${\cal U}_k(r_p,z_p,z_e)$ obtained by diagonalizing
the matrix ${\bf H}$ defined in Eq.~\ref{eq.PCETham}.
\par
The second step of this prescription is to calculate the proton
vibrational adiabatic states $\phi_\mu^{(k)}(r_p;z_p,z_e)$
for fixed $(z_p,z_e)$
for each relevant adiabatic electronic state $k$ by numerically solving
the one-dimensional Schr\"odinger equation
\begin{equation}
H_p^{(k)} \phi_{\mu}^{(k)}(r_p;z_p,z_e)=
\epsilon_{\mu}^{(k)}(z_p,z_e) \phi_\mu^{(k)}(r_p;z_p,z_e),
\label{eq.pcetpts}
\end{equation}
where the proton Hamiltonian for the electronic state $k$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
H_p^{(k)}=-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m_p}\frac{\partial^2}{\partial r_p^2}
+{\cal U}_k(r_p,z_p,z_e).
\label{eq.protham}
\end{equation}
\par
The third step of the prescription is
to calculate the
mixed electronic/proton vibrational adiabatic states $\Phi_n$ by expanding them
in a basis of double adiabatic states $\xi_{k\mu }$:
\begin{equation}
\Phi_n({\bf r}^{(e)},r_p;z_p,z_e)=\sum_{k\mu} 
D_{k\mu,n} \xi_{k\mu}({\bf r}^{(e)},r_p;z_p,z_e)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\xi_{k\mu}({\bf r}^{(e)},r_p;z_p,z_e)
=\Psi_k({\bf r}^{(e)};r_p,z_p,z_e) \phi_\mu^{(k)}(r_p;z_p,z_e).
\label{basisfunc}
\end{equation}
The mixed electronic/vibrational states are calculated by
solving the matrix equation
\begin{equation}
{\bf H}^{\rm total} {\bf D}={\bf D}{\bf E},
\end{equation}
where ${\bf D}$ has elements $D_{k\mu,n}$, ${\bf E}$ is diagonal with
elements $E_{n}$, and
the matrix elements of the Hamiltonian ${\bf H}^{\rm total}$ are
\begin{equation}
H_{k\mu,l\nu}^{\rm total} = \langle \xi_{k\mu}|H^{\rm total}|\xi_{l\nu}\rangle.
\end{equation}
It is straightforward to show that
\begin{equation}
H_{k\mu,l\nu}^{\rm total} =
\delta_{kl}\delta_{\mu\nu}\epsilon_\mu^{(k)}(z_p,z_e)
- \frac{\hbar^2}{m_p}\left\langle \phi_\mu^{(k)}\left|
d_{kl}^{(ep)} \frac{\partial \phi_\nu^{(l)}}{\partial r_p} 
\right.\right\rangle_p
- \frac{\hbar^2}{2m_p}\langle \phi_\mu^{(k)}|
g_{kl}^{(ep)}\phi_\nu^{(l)} \rangle_p,
\label{eq.hinjm}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
d_{kl}^{(ep)}(r_p,z_p,z_e)
=\left\langle \Psi_k \left| \frac{\partial \Psi_l}{\partial r_p} 
\right.\right\rangle_e
\label{epnonad1}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
g_{kl}^{(ep)}=\left\langle \Psi_k\left|\frac{\partial^2 \Psi_l}{\partial r_p^2}
\right.\right\rangle_e.
\label{epnonad2}
\end{equation} 
In these
equations $\langle \rangle_{ep}$, $\langle \rangle_e$, and $\langle \rangle_p$
indicate integration over $({\bf r}^{(e)}, r_p)$, ${\bf r}^{(e)}$, and
$r_p$, respectively.
\par
The energies of the mixed electronic/proton vibrational
adiabatic states are calculated
as functions of the two solvent scalar variables $z_p$ and $z_e$
by following the above three steps for solvent coordinates $(z_p,z_e)$
on a two-dimensional grid.

\subsubsection{Method 3: double-adiabatic approach}
This method is actually an approximation to the method 2
described above. It is assumed that the nonadiabatic coupling
terms $d_{kl}$ and $g_{kl}$ defined in Eqs.(\ref{epnonad1})
and (\ref{epnonad2}) are negligibly small and the total Hamiltonian
matrix is diagonal in the double adiabatic representation.
Thus the free energies are equal to the double-adiabatic
energies $\epsilon_\mu^{(k)}(z_p,z_e)$.

\subsection{Free Energy Surfaces in Different Representations}
In some specific cases it is useful to analyze different
types of free energy electronic/vibrational surfaces.
The program PCET can calculate free energies in three different
representations.

\subsubsection{Adiabatic Free Energy Surfaces ({\tw ADIAB})}
This is a most general representation. The corresponding states
are {\em adiabatic} with respect to the solvent motions and
all the couplings between the electronic EVB states as well
as all the nonadiabatic couplings between electronic and
proton motions are taken into account explicitly. The free
energies are calculated as eigenvalues of the total Hamiltonian
$H^{\rm total}$.

\subsubsection{ET-Diabatic Free Energy Surfaces ({\tw DIAB2})}
This representation is natural for the systems with strongly
nonadiabatic ET and adiabatic PT when the couplings between (1a/1b)
and (2a/2b) electronic VB states are small compared to the thermal energy
$k_{\rm B}T$. The two sets of the corresponding free energies
and mixed electronic/vibrational ET diabatic states are obtained
by applying one of the above mentioned methods to (1a/1b) or
(2a/2b) blocks of the electronic Hamiltonian matrix (\ref{eq.PCETham}).

\subsubsection{Diabatic Free Energy Surfaces ({\tw DIAB4})}
This representation is natural for the systems with strongly
nonadiabatic ET and PT when all the couplings between electronic
VB states are small compared to the thermal energy $k_{\rm B}T$.
Formally, it corresponds to the electronic Hamiltonian matrix
(\ref{eq.PCETham}) with zero off-diagonal matrix elements.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Gas Phase Model Potentials}
The model gas phase potentials implemented in the program are
based on the four-state EVB model with electronic basis states
defined in Eq.(\ref{eq.definepcetvb}). They differ by the
parameterization of the EVB matrix elements.

\subsection{Standard MM parameterization ({\tw MM1})}
The matrix elements of the gas phase Hamiltonian are approximated
by standard molecular mechanical terms fit to electronic structure
calculations for the gas phase solute. The diagonal matrix
elements are expressed as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
(h_{0})_{1a1a}(r_p) &=& U^{\rm{Morse}}_{NH}(r_p) + U^{\rm{rep}}_{OH}(r_p) +
U^{\rm{Coul}}_{1a}(r_p) \\ \nonumber
(h_{0})_{1b1b}(r_p) &=& U^{\rm{Morse}}_{OH}(r_p) + U^{\rm{rep}}_{NH}(r_p) +
U^{\rm{Coul}}_{1b}(r_p) + \Delta_{1b}\\ \nonumber
(h_{0})_{2a2a}(r_p) &=& U^{\rm{Morse}}_{NH}(r_p) + U^{\rm{rep}}_{OH}(r_p) +
U^{\rm{Coul}}_{2a}(r_p) + \Delta_{2a}\\ \nonumber
(h_{0})_{2b2b}(r_p) &=& U^{\rm{Morse}}_{OH}(r_p) + U^{\rm{rep}}_{NH}(r_p) +
U^{\rm{Coul}}_{2b}(r_p) + \Delta_{2b}
\label{eq.MM}
\end{eqnarray}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
U^{\rm{Morse}}_{AH}(r_p) = D_{AH}\left(1-e^{-\beta_{AH}(R_{AH}-R_{AH}^{o})}\right)^2
\label{Morse}
\end{equation}
%
is a Morse potential for an A-H bond,
%
\begin{equation}
U^{\rm{rep}}_{AH}(r_p) = D'_{AH}e^{-\beta'_{AH}R_{AH}}
\label{Rep}
\end{equation}
%
is a repulsion term between non-bonded atoms A and H, and
%
\begin{equation}
U^{\rm{Coul}}_{i}(r_p) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k\ne l}\frac{q_k^{i}q_l^{i}}{R_{kl}}
\label{Coul}
\end{equation}
%
is a Coulomb interaction potential between the point charges 
(where the summation is over
sites $k,l$ and $q_k^i$ is the charge on site $k$ for VB state $i$).
In all of these expressions $R_{kl}$ is the distance between sites
$k$ and $l$.
%
The couplings between the VB states are expressed as
%
\begin{eqnarray}
(h_o)_{1a,1b}(r_p) &=&  V^{PT1}\exp^{-\gamma_{\rm PT}(r_p-r_p^{\rm PT})^2}\\ \nonumber
(h_o)_{2a,2b}(r_p) &=&  V^{PT2}\exp^{-\gamma_{\rm PT}(r_p-r_p^{\rm PT})^2}\\ \nonumber
(h_o)_{1a,2a}(r_p) &=& (h_o)_{1b,2b}(r_p)
 = V^{ET}\exp^{-\gamma_{\rm ET}(r_p-r_p^{\rm ET})^2}  \\ \nonumber
(h_o)_{1a,2b}(r_p) &=& (h_o)_{1b,2a}(r_p)
 = V^{EPT}\exp^{-\gamma_{\rm EPT}(r_p-r_p^{\rm EPT})^2}.
\label{eq.offdiagparam}
\end{eqnarray}

\section{Solvation models}
\subsection{Ellipsoidal Model}
In this model the solute is represented by a set of point charges
located on one axis. Different charge distributions corresponding
to VB basis states are modelled by different magnitudes of point
charges. The point charges representing the solute are placed
on the main axis of an axially symmetrical ellipsoidal cavity
embedded in a dielectric continuum solvent characterized by the
inertial ($\epsilon_0$) and electronic (optical) ($\epsilon_\infty$)
dielectric constants (see Fig.~\ref{fig1}).
\begin{figure}[!bbb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[scale=0.65,angle=-90]{ellips.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Ellipsoidal model cavity and its geometrical parameters.}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}
\par
The total polarization potential $\phi(\mu,\lambda)$ at the point ($\mu$,$\lambda$) (elliptical coordinates) inside the cavity
can be expressed as\cite{Kirkwood38}
\begin{equation}
\phi(\mu,\lambda)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}B_n(\epsilon_0)P_n(\mu)P_n(\lambda)
\label{phi_tot}
\end{equation}
where $B_n$ are constants and $P_n$ are the Legendre functions
of the first kind. The expression for the coefficients $B_n$
is readily obtained from traditional electrostatics:
\begin{equation}
B_n=\frac{2(2n+1)\beta_n}{R}\left(\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}-1\right)
\frac{Q_n(\lambda_0)}{P_n(\lambda_0)}
\left[1-\frac{1}{\epsilon_0}
\frac{\lambda_0-P_{n-1}(\lambda_0)/P_n(\lambda_0)}
     {\lambda_0-Q_{n-1}(\lambda_0)/Q_n(\lambda_0)}
\right]^{-1}
\label{bcoef}
\end{equation}
Here $R$ is the interfocal distance, $\lambda_0$ defines the
ellipsoid boundary, $Q_n$ are the Legendre functions of the
second kind, and $\beta_n$ is given by the sum over the N
point charges with magnitudes $q_k$ and positions on the axis
$\mu_k$
\begin{equation}
\beta_n=\sum_{k=1}^N q_kP_n(\mu_k)
\label{beta}
\end{equation}
\par
The inertial polarization field is calculated as a difference
between the total field and the electronic polarization field:
\begin{equation}
\phi_{\mathrm in} = \phi - \phi_{\infty}
\label{phi_in}
\end{equation}
where $\phi_{\infty}$ is obtained using
Eqs.(\ref{phi_tot}-\ref{bcoef}) by substituting $\epsilon_0$
in Eq.(\ref{bcoef}) with $\epsilon_{\infty}$.
\par
The reorganization energy matrix elements are calculated
then on the grid along the proton coordinate by using standard definitions\cite{pcet-jcp1}:
\begin{eqnarray}
t_{ij} &=& -\sum_k q_k^{(i)}(\phi^{(j)}-\phi^{(j)}_{\infty}) \\
t_{ij}^{(\infty)} &=& -\sum_k q_k^{(i)}\phi^{(j)}_{\infty}
\label{tmat}
\end{eqnarray}
where indices $i$ and $j$ label charge distributions corresponding
to the VB basis states.

\subsection*{Reorganization energy matrix elements}
The multistate continuum theory requires the calculation
of the solvent
reorganization energy matrix elements defined as
\begin{equation}
t_{ij}=-\int d{\bf r}\, \rho_i \hat{\cal{K}}_{\mathrm{in}} \rho_j
= -\int d{\bf r}\, \rho_i \phi_j^{\mathrm{(in)}},\,\,\, \phi_j^{\mathrm{(in)}}=\hat{\cal{K}}_{\mathrm{in}} \rho_j
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
t_{ij}^{(\infty)}=-\int d{\bf r}\, \rho_i \hat{\cal{K}}_{\infty} \rho_j
= -\int d{\bf r}\, \rho_i \phi_j^{(\infty)},\,\,\, \phi_j^{(\infty)}=\hat{\cal{K}}_{\infty} \rho_j.
\end{equation}
Here the operator $\hat{\cal{K}}_\infty=\hat{\cal{K}}(\epsilon_\infty)$
and $\hat{\cal{K}}_{\mathrm{in}}=\hat{\cal{K}}(\epsilon_o)-
\hat{\cal{K}}(\epsilon_\infty)$,
where $\hat{\cal{K}}(\epsilon)$ is a dielectric Green
function for the medium with dielectric constant $\epsilon$ and
$\epsilon_o$ and $\epsilon_\infty$ are the static and
electronic dielectric constants, respectively.
The calculation of these reorganization energies
requires the calculation of the potentials
$\phi_j^{(\infty)}=\hat{\cal{K}}(\epsilon_\infty) \rho_j$ and
$\phi_j^{\mathrm{(tot)}} = \hat{\cal{K}}(\epsilon_o) \rho_j$
caused by the charge density $\rho_j$ in a dielectric continuum
with dielectric constant $\epsilon_\infty$ and $\epsilon_o$, respectively.
The inertial potential may be calculated from these
two potentials: 
\begin{equation}
\phi_j^{\mathrm{(in)}}=\phi_j^{\mathrm{(tot)}}
- \phi_j^{\mathrm{(\infty)}}.
\label{eq.phiin}
\end{equation}
The FRCM method is used to calculate these potentials.
%
\subsection*{Calculation of the electrostatic potential due to solvent response}
%
The standard PCM method is used to calculate the
electronic solvent potential $\phi_j^{(\infty)}$.
In this method,
the entire charge density $\rho_j$ is placed in a
cavity of arbitrary shape with surface $S$.
The dielectric
constant is equal to unity
inside the cavity and is equal to $\epsilon_\infty$
outside the cavity.
The electronic solvent potential $\phi_j^{(\infty)}$ is calculated by solving
the Poisson equation
with the appropriate boundary conditions at the surface of the
cavity.
(Note that the total potential used in the Poisson
equation is the sum of the potential
due to the charge density $\rho_j$ in a vacuum
and the solvent potential $\phi_j^{(\infty)}$ describing 
the potential due to the solvent response to the density $\rho_j$.)
The solvent potential 
may be expressed in terms of a surface charge density $\sigma_j$
on the surface $S$.  Thus, the problem is reduced to
the calculation of
this surface charge density $\sigma_j$ corresponding
to the charge density $\rho_j$.
The surface charge density $\sigma_j$ may be defined
in terms of a standard integral equation, which must
be solved iteratively.  
\par
The FRCM method is used to calculate the
total solvent potential $\phi_i^{\mathrm{(tot)}}$.
In this method,
two cavities are formed around the charge density $\rho_j$.  
This leads to an inner
surface $S_1$ and an outer surface $S_2$.
The entire charge density is assumed to be
contained inside the inner cavity.
The dielectric constant is equal to unity inside
the inner cavity, to $\epsilon_\infty$ in the
region between the two surfaces $S_1$ and $S_2$, and to $\epsilon_o$
in the region outside the outer cavity.
The solvent potential $\phi_j^{\mathrm{(tot)}}$ is calculated by solving
the Poisson equation
with the appropriate boundary conditions at the two surfaces
$S_1$ and $S_2$.
(Again, note that the total potential used in the Poisson
equation is the sum of the potential
due to the charge density $\rho_j$ in a vacuum
and the solvent potential $\phi_j^{\mathrm{(tot)}}$ describing 
the potential due to the solvent response to the density $\rho_j$.)
The solvent potential 
may be expressed in terms of two surface charge distributions
$\sigma_j^{(1)}$ and $\sigma_j^{(2)}$ on the surfaces $S_1$ and $S_2$, 
respectively.
In this case, the problem requires
the calculation of
both surface charge distributions corresponding
to the charge density $\rho_j$.
These surface charge densities may be defined
in terms of integral equations which must
be solved iteratively.  
\par
In order to numerically solve
the integral equations for both PCM and FRCM, the
surface integrals are computed
by dividing the surface into small pieces.  
These surface
elements are denoted ``tesserae" or  ``sectors" (where the terms
are used interchangably, although a
sector actually refers to a three-dimensional segmenet
and a tesserae actually refers to only the surface element).
The convergence of the iterative solution of the Poisson equation is
determined by the dimensionless parameter SELFCR, where
the convergence criterion is defined to be SELFCR$\times 10^{-4}$
for the outer cavity and SELFCR$\times 10^{-5}$ for the inner cavity.
The default is SELFCR=2.0.  In past versions, the keyword PRECISE 
decreases this to SELFCR=0.2, but
this word should not be used in the current version.
After the surface charge density has converged, it is
renormalized according to the total charge of the solute.
If the total surface charge computed from the
numerical surface charge density differs from the value
determined by the total solute charge
by more than CHDIFF directly prior to the renormalization
of the surface charge density, an error message
is printed.  The default value
is CHDIFF=0.1.
The maximum number of iterations is ITSE, after which an
error message is printed and the program is stopped.
The default value is ITSE=15.
\par
Thus, the calculation of the electronic and inertial
potentials requires the following steps:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Generate the surfaces of the two cavities.}
\item{Generate the tesserae independently for the two cavities.}
\item{Numerically solve the Poisson equation using PCM for the inner
cavity surrounded by solvent with dielectric constant $\epsilon_\infty$
to obtain the electronic potential $\phi_j^{(\infty)}$.}
\item{Numerically solve the Poisson equation using FRCM for the two cavities
with solvent of dielectric constant $\epsilon_\infty$ in between
the two surfaces and $\epsilon_o$ outside both cavities
to obtain the total potential $\phi_j^{\mathrm{(tot)}}$.}
\item{Calculate the inertial
potential $\phi_j^{\mathrm{(in)}}=\phi_j^{\mathrm{(tot)}}
- \phi_j^{(\infty)}$.}
\item{Use these potentials to calculate the electronic
and inertial reorganization energy matrix elements.}
\end{enumerate}
%
\subsection*{Generation of surfaces}
%
In FRCM, the inner cavity is generated by placing
a sphere centered on each atom with radius $\kappa r_{vdw}$,
where $r_{vdw}$ is the van der Waals radius for the specific atom
and $\kappa$ is independent of the solvent
with a default value of 0.9.
In the FRCM program, the surface of the inner cavity
may be smoothed by including additional spheres.
The key words SMOOTH and NOSMOOTH denote cavity smoothing
or the absence of cavity smoothing.  The default is to include
smoothing.  
The parameter SOLRD defines the effective radius (in Angstroms) of the solvent
molecules and is used to calculate the excluded volume at the
seam of a pair of overlapping spheres.
The default value is SOLRD=1~\AA.
The parameter EXVOL defines
the minimum excluded volume (in cubic Angstroms) at such a seam
for which an auxiliary sphere is
added during smoothing.  The default value is EXVOL=1~\AA$^{3}$.
If EXVOL (or SOLRD) is large enough, the effect is the same as
using the key word NOSMOOTH.
The outer sphere cavity is generated by adding
$\delta$ to the radius of each sphere used to create
the inner cavity (including the spheres added for smoothing).
In general, $\delta$ depends on the solvent.
%
\subsection*{Generation of tesserae/sectors}
%
The premise of the method for generation of the tesserae (or sectors)
is that the surface charges
change more rapidly closer to the seam of the intersection
between two spheres.  Thus, the surface elements should be
chosen to be smaller in the regions of close contact of the spheres.
The following three steps are used to generate the tesserae.
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The first step
is to create a network of A-sectors for each pair of spheres.  
These sectors
are smaller in contact regions (i.e., where the spheres overlap) and larger
in regions near the poles.
The tesserae are created through a series
of rings moving from a contact region to a pole.
The tesserae (or sectors) are defined in terms of
the standard polar angles $\theta$ and $\phi$, where
$0<\theta<180^o$ and $0<\phi<360^o$, and $\theta$
is measured relative to the axis connecting the centers of the pair
of spheres.  The parameters that determine the sizes of the A-sectors
and the basic procedure used to create the A-sectors
are as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item{The parameters that determine the sizes of the A-sectors
are MODFE1 and MODFE2 for the inner and outer surfaces,
respectively.  
This discussion will use MODFE1 as the example.
The maximum angular step size $\Delta \theta$ for $\theta$ is defined
as 
\begin{equation}
N=400/3/\mbox{MODFE1}.
\end{equation}
For the default value of MODFE1=6, $N=22.2^o$.
The first two rings near the contact region have
$\Delta \theta=0.6N$ and $\Delta \theta =0.9N$, respectively, and the remaining
rings have $\Delta \theta= N$.
The values for these angular step sizes are stored in the
array DDTET, where the first element is $0.6N$,
the second element is $0.9N$, and the remaining elements are $N$.
The number of elements is such that the sum of all angles
is less than 180$^o$.  Thus, for MODFE1=6,
DDTET=(13.3, 20.0, 22.2, 22.2, 22.2, 22.2, 22.2, 22.2).
The angle $\phi$ has the same angular step size $\Delta \phi$ as $\theta$
except for the first two rings, where $\Delta \phi=1.33 \Delta \theta$
and $\Delta \phi=1.28 \Delta \theta$, respectively.}
\item{
The A-sectors are created for each pair in the following manner.
First, the angle in $\theta$ for the overlap between the spheres
is determined to exclude it from consideration.
Second, the sectors are created through a series of rings, using
the angular step sizes from the array DDTET,
starting at the contact
region and moving toward the pole.
The sectors are renormalized to render the total sum of
angular steps
for $\theta$ and $\phi$ $180^o$ and $360^o$, respectively.
Since this procedure is done for each pair of spheres,
for each sphere there is a combination of overlapping
networks of A-sectors due to all of its neighbors.}
\item{
The relation between MODFE1 and MODFE2 is critical to the numerical
accuracy.  Typically, for MODFE1=MODFE2, the number of
tesserae is significantly greater for the inner surface than
for the outer surface.
This results from the greater overlap between the larger spheres
for the outer surface, leading to a larger value of the
excluded angle $\theta$ and thus to a smaller number
of tesserae for each pair of spheres.  In addition,
the spheres added for smoothing  of the inner surface do not
contribute as much to the surface area of the outer cavity.
Furthermore, for MODFE1=MODFE2,
the tesserae are larger in surface area for the
outer surface than for the inner surface.
This inconsistency between the size and
number of tesserae on the two surfaces leads to numerical
instabilities.
One approach is to choose MODFE2 
such that the maximum area of the tesserae for the
inner and outer surfaces is approximately equal.  This
can be achieved using the equation
\begin{equation}
\mbox{MODFE2}=\mbox{MODFE1}*(\kappa r_{vdw}+\delta)/(\kappa r_{vdw})
\end{equation}
for a typical value of $r_{vdw}$ for the system of interest.
Another approach is to choose MODFE2 such that the number
of tesserae on the inner and outer surfaces is nearly equal.
}
\end{itemize}}
\item{
The second step 
to create a network of small elements, called
B-sectors.  These are also defined in terms of the angles $\theta$ and
$\phi$.
The angular step sizes are defined
in terms of NTETFI1 and NTETFI2 for the inner and outer cavities,
respectively.  This discussion will use NTETFI1 as the example.
The angular step sizes are defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
\Delta \phi &=& 360/(\mbox{NTETFI1} * 120) \\
\Delta \theta &=& 180/(\mbox{NTETFI1} * 60).
\end{eqnarray}
The default is NTETFI1=NTETFI2=1, which leads to step sizes of 3$^o$.
This leads to 7200 B-sectors per sphere.}
\item{
In the third step of the generation of the tesserae, 
the A-sectors and the B-sectors are used to construct a unique
set of sectors completely covering the whole surface, called
the C-sectors.  In this procedure, each B-sector is
related to the A-sector derived from the neighboring sphere
closest to it.  Thus, each B-sector is uniquely related
to an A-sector.  The B-sectors related to
the same A-sector are combined as a cluster
called a C-sector.  The network of C-sectors
completely and uniquely covers the cavity surface.
In order to decrease the total number of C-sectors,
some of the C-sectors are combined with neighboring smaller ones.}

\section{Nonadiabatic Rate Calculation}
The program PCET 2.0 calculates the nonadiabatic rate of the PCET
reaction using the expression derived in Ref.~\cite{pcet-jcp2}
for the case of nonadiabatic ET and adiabatic PT. Note that
only in this regime the results are meaningful. The rate expression
reads
\begin{equation}
k=\frac{2\pi}{\hbar}\sum_{\mu}P_{\mu}^{\mathrm I}
\sum_{\nu}V_{\mu\nu}^2
(4\pi\lambda_{\mu\nu}k_{\mathrm B}T)^{-1/2}\,
\exp\left\{-\frac{(\Delta G_{\mu\nu}^0+\lambda_{\mu\nu})^2}
{4\lambda_{\mu\nu}k_{\mathrm B}T}\right\}.
\label{na-rate}
\end{equation}
Here the indices $\mu$ and $\nu$ run over the reactant and product
mixed electronic/vibrational states, respectively. These states
are calculated in the {\tw DIAB2} representation and
correspond to the reactant and product states in the ET reaction.
The couplings $V_{\mu\nu}$ are calculated at the intersection
points along the straight line connecting the minima of reactant
and product two-dimensional surfaces. The two-dimensional reorganization energies are calculated either numerically (from actual two-dimensional
surface according to Marcus definition) or analytically using
the expression (55) from Ref.~\cite{pcet-jcp2}. The activation
energies in the exponential of Eq.(\ref{na-rate}) also
can be calculated either numerically (from the intersecting
surfaces) or analytically using the Marcus-like relation.


%=======================================================================
\chapter{Compiling and Execution}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Compiling PCET 2.0}
To compile PCET 2.0 program for a specific platform you need
change to the {\tw source} directory, then
copy {\tw Makefile.xxx} to {\tw Makefile}, for example

\begin{description}
\item {\tw cp Makefile.xxx Makefile}
\item {\tw make all}
\end{description}

\noindent where {\tw <xxx>} must be substituted by
the platform-specific suffix. With the present version two
makefiles are supplied:
\par\noindent
\begin{tabular}{lcp{8cm}}
{\tw Makefile.sgi} &-& for SGI platforms \\
{\tw Makefile.lnx} &-& for LINUX platforms with Portland
      Group FORTRAN compiler {\tw pgf77} \\
\end{tabular}

This will initiate compiling and linking of the program. First,
the makefile will build an object library containing all the object
files except the object file for the main program. Then the
makefile will combine the main object file with the library
and produce the executable {\tw pcet2.0.xxx} which will
be placed in the {\tw bin} directory.

When you modify the include files with parameters and array
dimensions, you {\bf must} recompile all the source codes
and build a new library. To remove the old object library
run the command

\begin{description}
\item {\tw make clean}
\end{description}


%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Running PCET 2.0}

You can run PCET 2.0 program from any directory you wish provided
that the path to the executable is listed in your {\tw PATH}
variable or you have a link to the executable in your current
directory.

You will need four mandatory (and maybe more optional) input files
in your current directory. The main input file (control file)
with arbitrary name contains the control information
(keywords) about the jobs you want to run. It contains
also the names of other optional input files you may
want to use. The other three mandatory files are the files
with geometry specifications for gas phase and solvation
calculations (you can use the same file for both gas phase
and solvation calculations) and the file with parameters
of the gas phase potential. The names of these files are
specified in the keyword section of the control input file.
The detailed information about the structure of the input
files is given in the next chapter.

To initiate execution you have to run the command

\begin{description}
\item {\tw pcet2.0.xxx <name-of-the-control-input-file>}
\end{description}

The program will generate a screen output (you might want to
redirect it to disk using standard redirection rules) and
also other optional output files which will be placed
in the new subdirectory with the name specified in the title
section of the control input file.


%=======================================================================
\chapter{Structure of the DATA Files}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Control Input File}

\subsection{General structure}
The control input file consists of blocks separated by
empty lines. Each block contains the control information
for a particular job. The program reads blocks sequentially
and terminates when it finds the word {tw END} in the
beginning (first three positions) of the block. All the
lines in the control input file must be not longer
than 80 symbols. The symbols after first 80 are ignored.

Each block consists of three sections:
\begin{enumerate}
\item TITLE SECTION (one line) -
      the title of the job and optionally the keyword
      specifiyng the name of the job. This keyword
      has the following format: {\tw JOBNAME=<name-of-the-job>}.
      If this keyword is specified the program will
      create a subdirectory {\tw name-of-the-job}
      for optional output files. Otherwise a subdirectory
      with the standard name (consequtive number of the job)
      will be created.

\item COMMENT SECTION (one line) -
      any text specifying the current job

\item KEYWORDS SECTION (as many lines as you want but the total
      number of symbols should not exceed 480) - the keywords
      controlling the job. The detailed description of all
      the keywords and related options is given in the next
      subsection.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Keywords}
There are two types of keywords in the PCET 2.0 program. The keywords
of the first type set some global controls for the job and are
mandatory. The keywords of the second type provide the control
information about specific tasks which should be performed.
Usually these keywords require mandatory set of options given
in brackets. The format for the first type of keywords is
(no spaces before or after "="!)

\begin{description}
\item {\tw KEYWORD=<value>}
\end{description}

\noindent The format for the second type is (no spaces before
the opening bracket!)

\begin{description}
\item {\tw KEYWORD(Option1,Option2,Option3,...)}
\end{description}

\noindent The keywords are case-insensitive and should be separated
by spaces. The options are separated by commas and are case-insensitive
as well.

Below is the list of keywords with detailed descriptions.

         the calculation of non-adiabatic "$d$" and "$g$"
         derivative terms.

\item[{\tw SYMET}] - the solvent reorganization energy martices are
symmetrized so that the properties for a symmetric ET system are
correctly reproduced. (NOTE, this should only be used with the ET2
keyword.
\item[{\tw SYMPT}] - the solvent reorganization energy martices are
symmetrized so that the properties for a symmetric PT system are
correctly reproduced. (NOTE, this should only be used with the PT2

energy martices which depend on 2b are obtained from all the other
elements depending only on 1a,1b,2a.  This should always be true anyway.  
A system for which this is not true has some major problems and should
be used with caution. This keyword can also be used when the
charges for the 2b state for solvation are not obtainable.  (simply
put in any charges that are not all zero 
and such that the column has at least 
one different element from the other columns:1a,1b,and 2a.)
